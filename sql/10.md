# SQL DELETE 语句




## DELETE 语句

DELETE 语句用于删除表中的行。

### 语法

```
DELETE FROM 表名称 WHERE 列名称 = 值
```

## Person:

| LastName | FirstName | Address | City |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gates | Bill | Xuanwumen 10 | Beijing |
| Wilson | Fred | Zhongshan 23 | Nanjing |

## 删除某行

"Fred Wilson" 会被删除：

```
DELETE FROM Person WHERE LastName = 'Wilson'
```

### 结果:

| LastName | FirstName | Address | City |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gates | Bill | Xuanwumen 10 | Beijing |

## 删除所有行

可以在不删除表的情况下删除所有的行。这意味着表的结构、属性和索引都是完整的：

```
DELETE FROM table_name
```

或者：

```
DELETE * FROM table_name
```
